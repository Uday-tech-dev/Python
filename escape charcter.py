\tWhiskers loved to exploree\b the dark forest near his home.\\
One day, he found a glowingg\b stone under a giant oak tree.\\
As he touched it, the stone started to hummm\b and vibrate.\\
\\
Suddenly, a portal opened, showing a worldd\b of floating islands!\\
\tWhiskers whispered, /Is this real??\b?/ and stepped inside.\\
He saw birds flying upsidee\b down and rivers flowing in circles.\\
A friendly owl told him, /You are in the Land of Apes!!\b!/\\
Before Whiskers could react, a giant ape started chasing him!\\
\tHe ran as fast as he could, dodging trees and jumping rocks.\\
At the last moment, he found another portal and leaped through.\\
Whiskers landed back home, panting. "No more portals for me!"\\
And so, his wildest adventure ended with a lucky escape...\\\b""")
